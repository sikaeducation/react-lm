# Simplified Neuroscience

It can be helpful to know what's happening in your brain when you learn something.

## Sensory Input

Sensory input--sounds, sights, smells, etc.--go to your thalamus, which acts as a traffic cop. You always receive more sensory input than you can process, so your thalamus determines what you do and don't need to pay attention to. Lots of sensations are discarded, many are sent to your cortexes for further processing, and a few are flagged as dangerous and sent to your amygdala.

Your amygdala is your brain's alarm system. Its job is to figure out if something is dangerous, either because it might physically hurt you or because it's psychologically threatening. If your amygdala classifies a sensory input as dangerous, it tells your hypothalamus to put your body on full alert.

A few things happen when your body is alerted:

* Your ability to fight or run away is enhanced
* Your ability to make rational decisions is severely compromised
* You encode memories better but you recall them worse

This is called an "amygdala hijack," and while it may help you escape predators more effectively it has a ruinous effect on your ability to learn things. 3 slow, deep breaths is a shortcut for getting out of amygdala hijack and regaining some of your decision-making abilities.

## Neural Networks

Your cortexes are made up of billions of interconnected neurons. When you have a thought, a particular pattern in that network fires. This doesn't happen perfectly every time, however. Neurons that recently joined the network fire less reliably, neurons that have fired more often start to fire every time.

As you continue to practice and think about something, the stronger that neural network becomes. That means it fires quicker and more consistently, which manifests as you being able to do complicated things easily.

Some important things to note about neural networks:

* Neural networks don't have any concept of recency, just repetition. If you practice something incorrectly 9 times and get it right on the 10th, your neural network for doing it incorrectly will be stronger because it's been exercised 9x more.
* It's tempting to think about your brain as a computer hard drive, where memories are stored as discrete things that can be retrieved. This is inaccurate. Your memories _are_ the neural network, which only exists when it's firing. This means that you don't just read memories, your brain creates them every time they're requested.
* Neural networks are constantly changing. Your brain reorganizes networks to make things that are frequently accessed together fire together easier and prunes things from your memories that aren't accessed.

The reason all this matters in education is that there are is no hack around repetition; if you want to be good at something, you need to do it a lot.

## Rich Thinking vs. Linear Thinking

![Rich and linear thinking](https://ik.imagekit.io/sikaeducation/education/sika-education/rich-vs-linear__DMsDm3t0L3.png?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1645839864094)

You brain has two modes: Rich and linear.

Rich mode is like a powerful search engine that can comb your memories and connect seemingly unrelated things. The concept of "shower thoughts" are the rich brain at work. It doesn't use language, which is why things from your rich brain feel like revelations. This mode can't be summoned or controlled, only invited.

Linear mode is about task execution and problem-solving. This is the mode that's active when you're solving a math problem. This is the mode your brain idles in.

These modes use the same resources, so only one can be active at a time. You can't intentionally activate your rich mode, but there are some tricks for inviting it:

* **Take regular breaks**: These aren't rewards to yourself, they're opportunities to allow your rich mode to work.
* **Meditation**: Meditation helps create enough mental space for your rich mode to function.
* **Work with others**: When you work alone, it's easy to lock into an unhelpful context that you won't be able to clear until you take a break. When you work in pairs or groups, it's possible to have some people thinking linearly and others thinking rich at the same time.
