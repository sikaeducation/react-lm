# Passive vs. Active Learning

## Passive Learning

The most common type of passive learning is called transmissionism. In transmissionism, an expert transfers their knowledge to a novice directly, usually by explaining it in a lecture, book, or video.

Transmissionism has low efficacy. Encoding knowledge requires rehearsal and feedback, not just sensory input. This is the dominant style of education in K-12 and university education.

## Active Learning

Active learning is when the learner plays an active role in the learning process, such as by performing activities and discussing with others. There are two different but related theories that support active learning: Constructivism and humanism. While ideas from both systems are used, this program primarily adheres to humanist principles:

* Learning is driven by the individual, not the educator
* Emotional growth is an inseparable part of learning facts and skills
* Self-reflection is a critical part of the learning process

Active learning demands a lot from learners, both cognitively and emotionally. However, it produces superior results compared to passive techniques.
