# Testing React Components with Jest and RTL

Testing React components is similar to testing anything with Testing Library and Jest DOM. All of the same queries and matchers are available. Since React uses JSX instead of DOM elements, React Testing Library adds a way to render JSX elements to a fake DOM and then query them.

## Installation and Configuration

### Create React App

If you're using Create React App, `jest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, and `@testing-library/user-event` are already installed and configured.

Any file in any directory that ends in `.test.js` will be run when `npm test` is run.

### Existing React Apps

To set up testing for an existing React project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
npm i -D jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
```

Then define a testing script in the project's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest src/**/*.test.js"
  }
}
```

## Creating Tests

To create a test, create a file ending in `.test.js`. By convention, it's common to have one test file per component file, and they should both be named the same as the component. For example, a component called `LoginForm` should be in a file called `LoginForm.js` and have a test file called `LoginForm.test.js`. There are no requirements for where any of these files live in the folder hierarchy.

A simple test file imports the component being tested, as well as testing functions as needed:

```jsx
import SomeComponent from "./SomeComponent"
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react"

test("Test name goes here", () => {
  render(<SomeComponent />)

  const someElement = screen.getByRole("header")

  expect(someElement).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

It's not necessary to import `jest`, `test`, `describe`, `it`, `beforeAll`, `beforeEach`, or `expect`. They will added to the environment by Jest when running the tests.

## Basic Parts of React Component Test

The two most critical parts of React Testing Library are `render` and `screen`.

### `render`

Components are added to the test DOM with with the `render` method:

```jsx
render(<p>Hi!</p>)
render(<SomeComponent someProp="Some Value" />
```

Note that you can pass elements, components, and even entire hierarchies into `render`:

```jsx
render(
  <SomeContext.Provider value="Hi!">
    <div>
      <SomeComponent someProp="Aloha!" />
    </div>
  </SomeContext.Provider>
)
```

### `screen`

DOM elements are retrieved by querying `screen`:

```jsx
const element = screen.findByRole("Heading")
```

This element is a regular DOM element rather than a component instance. Rather than running assertions on parts of the element, it's common to use the Jest matchers that are added by `@testing-library/jest-dom`.

## Rerendering

Occasionally, it may be useful to test how a component re-renders. To do this, destructure the `rerender` function out of the original call to `render`. This `rerender` function accepts a new JSX element.

```jsx
import { render, screen, waitFor } from "@testing-library/react"
import { click } from "@testing-library/user-event"
import SomeComponent from "./SomeComponent"

test("loads and displays greeting", async () => {
  const { rerender } = render(<SomeComponent url="/greeting" />)

  expect(screen.getByRole('heading')).toHaveTextContent('hello there')

  rerender(<SomeComponent url="/greeting" />)

  expect(screen.getByRole('heading')).toHaveTextContent('hello there')
})
```

## Running Tests

To run tests, run `npm test`. The `jest` test runner will automatically keep running and wait for changes and rerun the tests in response.

## Watch Out!

* `@testing-library/jest-dom` (which adds DOM matchers to Jest) is automatically imported into each test with Create React App, but must be added if you're configuring testing manually.
* `render` is a function, `screen` is an object
* You only need to `waitFor` one thing, even if you're waiting for multiple changes to render.
* Async tests can either use `async`/`await` or just return a promise, but shouldn't do both.
* Within tests, always use `async`/`await` rather than `.then`/`.catch`. The enhanced readability of error handling in `.then`/`.catch` chains isn't useful in tests since all errors are automatically handled by the testing framework.
