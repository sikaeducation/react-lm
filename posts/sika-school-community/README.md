# School Community

Most schools only have multiple students in a course as an operational convenience. Any one student's experience would not be meaningfully different if they were the only person there. In Sika's programs, learners and coaches are all part of a community and rely on each other for everything from emotional support to technical help.

In traditional education, the teacher is the source of all knowledge and they benevolently dole it out to the empty minds of their students. At Sika we believe everyone has something to learn from everyone else and we try to reduce the natural hierarchy of "teachers" and "students". Instead of a class of 20 having 1 teacher, we want it to be 21 people pursuing a common goal and organizing their collective resources to get there together.

## Attitude

Some attitudes that are helpful:

* Changing careers is a whole-person transformation, not a set of tricks you pick-up. It's the difference between learning French and becoming French.
* The success of your fellow learners should matter to you. If someone else is struggling, find a way to help them out. Conveniently, helping someone else also benefits you directly; if you really want to understand a topic, try explaining it to someone who's struggling and you will quickly find the boundaries of your own understanding. You're encouraged to organize your own peer study sessions and lessons.
* Everyone has something to teach you. You could learn from helping them wrestle with something that you haven't before, you could learn something that helped them be successful in their last career, you could learn new metaphors and mental models, you could learn new software development techniques or technologies, you may even learn something about what you don't want to do. All of this is valuable.
* Not every day is a winner. One of the things we emphasize is lots of fresh starts and lots of closure. If something got you down one day, the clap at stand-down means that you can officially let it go. The clap at stand-up means that no matter how successful you were yesterday, it's time to make a plan to make today count.

Some attitudes that are not helpful:

* "I'm not here to make friends!" You are absolutely here to make friends, this is your first professional network as an engineer and you'll need your friends' help to get through this.
* "I'm the top of the class!" There is no top, bottom, or middle. There isn't a single line that everyone is plotted on. There is no score. We're all on our own journeys that are distinct from everyone else's. This is an especially dangerous attitude early in the program and more than once has prevented someone from learning the kind of hustle and discipline they need to be successful later in the program.
* "I'm the worst in the class!" Likewise, this is a meaningless statement. People come from different backgrounds, are building on different prior knowledge, and will likely struggle with things that come quickly to you.
* "Dude, where's my lecture?" If you were well-rewarded by traditional education, this program will be a culture shock and will take some getting used to. There are no rigid outlines, fixed paths, or 4 hour lectures, and as little is scheduled in advance as possible. This isn't a shortcoming, it keeps the program focused on outcomes and responsive to reality.

There are parts of those program that may feel silly or superfluous, such as the games, clapping, or Feelings Friday. All of them have a purpose, and the program is both more efficacious for everyone (and way more fun) if you jump in with both feet instead of trying to find reasons where they're not serious enough for you.

## Behavior

Some things we care about:

* Making everyone feel actively valued, safe and welcome
* Content, intent, and impact of what people say
* Owning your behavioral mistakes and working to repair any damage your actions cause

We will take corrective action if something is endangering those things.

Things we don't care about:

* Comparing people or their work
* Formality of language. We're not the swear-word police.

Also keep in mind that unless otherwise stated (such as a private conversation), assume your employer can observe whatever you're doing and act accordingly.

## Alums

Sika's programs grew out of several programs from other schools. Many of those learners and coaches are still involved with the Sika community and want to help you. They know what it's like to go through a huge career transition and can be everything from a kind ear to your debugging partner. When you finish the program, you will welcome to stay and participate in the community as well.
