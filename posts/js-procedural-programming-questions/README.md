> What is a programming paradigm?

> What is procedural programming?

> How would you chain the following variable declarations?

```js
let firstName = "Buster"
let lastName = "Poindexter"
let age = 12
```

> What's the difference between a function and a procedure?

> Rewrite the following operations to be more concise

```js
age = age + 1
daysRemaining = daysRemaining - 7
```

> What are the 3 parts to a `for` loop initialization?

> Rewrite this `for..of` loop to use a `while` loop:

```js
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "carrot"]
for (let fruit of fruit){
  console.log(fruit)
}
```

> Rewrite this `for..of` loop to use a regular `for` loop:

```js
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "carrot"]
for (let fruit of fruit){
  console.log(fruit)
}
```

> What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?

> Rewrite this `if` statement to use a `switch` statement:

```js
if (fruit === "apple"){
  console.log("It's an apple!")
} else if (fruit === "banana"){
  console.log("It's a banana!")
} else if (fruit === "carrot"){
  console.log("It's a carrot!")
} else {
  console.log("I don't know what it is!")
}
```
