The [Dreyfuss model of skill acquistion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) is a helpful model for understanding how people learn things. An intuitive understanding of skill acquisition looks something like this:

1. You learn all the abstract concepts of a skill: Terminology, concepts, grammar
2. You learn models for how they fit together
. You apply what you've learned

This isn't how skills are actually acquired. When you learned your primary language, you didn't start by learning about verbs and nouns; you learned how to express specific things by imitating others. This is how skill acquisition actually occurs:

1. You can apply a uniform set of rules and procedures
2. You can conditionally apply rules based on different situations
3. You can place different aspects of the skill into a cohesive mental model
4. You can apply your understanding of the mental model intuitively
5. You can solve the problem the skill is designed to solve without rules or models

## What the model means

What's interesting about the Dreyfuss model is that the beginning and the end are complete opposites. A beginner needs context-free rules, but an expert needs rule-free context.

This means that when you're learning something, it's OK to not understand everything before you start trying.
