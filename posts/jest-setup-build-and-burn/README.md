# Jest Setup Build and Burn

Create a new Node project, initialize it as a Git repository, and connect it to a remote repository on GitHub.

1. Install Jest
2. In an index.js file, write a simple math function
3. Create a test file that imports this file and tests its behavior
4. Add a test running script to `package.json`
5. Verify that the tests work
6. Commit your changes
7. Delete all of the files in the folder (don't delete the `.git` folder!)
8. Commit your changes

Repeat this process 5 times, then **Submit your public GitHub URL**, not the git URL.
