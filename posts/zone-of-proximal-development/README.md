# Zone of Proximal Development

![Zone of proximal development](https://ik.imagekit.io/sikaeducation/education/sika-education/zpd_QNKsEE9EQGi.svg?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1645841182921)

The [Zone of proximal development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development), or ZPD, is the idea that a learner can be in one of 3 zones:

* **Safe Zone**: The safe zone contains tasks the learner can do without help
* **Zone of Proximal Development**: The ZPD contains tasks the learner can do with guidance and assistance
* **Danger Zone**: The danger zone contains tasks the learner can't do no matter how much help they receive

When you learn something, things that used to be in the danger zone move into the ZPD, and then eventually move into the safe zone. As once-impossible tasks move into the safe zone, it can be tempting to eschew tasks in the ZPD. However, growth can only occur in the ZPD. In one respect this means that if you're always learning, you're always uncomfortable. Much like athletes do with physical exertion, you have some control over your relationship with this feeling. While you can't make it go away, you can recognize it for what it is; a sign that you're getting better.
