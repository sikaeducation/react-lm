# Codesandbox.io

Codesandbox.io is a browser-based application for writing code, running it in real-time, and sharing it with others. It's a little lighter-weight than GitHub Codespaces and doesn't have to be based on an existing repository.

## Creating Sandboxes

You can either create a sandbox from a predefined template or based off of a GitHub repo. Creating from a template is good for experiments, examples, or other situations where you don't care about saving the code back to a repo. Copying from GitHub repos is good for sharing examples of edits to existing code.

## Sharing Sandboxes

To share a sandbox, send its URL. Other users won't be able to change your code without forking their own copy.
