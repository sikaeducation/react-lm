> It returns an array with the same number of values it started with. Is it `.filter()` or `.find()`?

> It returns an array with a different number of values than it started with. Is it `.filter()` or a `.find()`?

> It returns something other than an array. Is it `.filter()` or a `.find()`?

> It starts and ends with an array. Is it `.filter()` or a `.find()`?

> It returns `null`. Is it `.filter()` or a `.find()`?

> Write a filter function that filters `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` down to `[5, 7, 9]`

> Write a filter function that filters `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` down to `[2, 4]`

> Write a filter function that filters `["cat", "bird", "snake", "piggy", "walrus", "capybara"]` down to `["piggy", "walrus", "capybara"]`

> Write a filter function that filters `[{ name: "Alice", paid: true }, { name: "Bill", paid: false }, { name: "Carol", paid: true }]` down to `[{ name: "Alice", paid: true }, { name: "Carol", paid: true }]`

> Write a filter function that filters `[{ name: "Alice", age: 8 }, { name: "Bill", age: 20 }, { name: "Carol", age: 18 }]` down to `[{ name: "Bill", age: 20 }, { name: "Carol", age: 18 }]`

> Write a find function that finds `walrus"` in `["cat", "bird", "snake", "piggy", "walrus", "capybara"]`

> Write a find function that finds `{ name: "Bill", age: 20 }` in `[{ name: "Alice", age: 8 }, { name: "Bill", age: 20 }, { name: "Carol", age: 18 }]`
