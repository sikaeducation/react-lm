# Build and Burn

A hallmark of Sika's programs is the concept of build and burns. The idea is that instead of building something once and moving on, you set your work aside, start over fresh, and continue to rebuild it until you don't have to think about what you're doing anymore. This is called building [automaticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaticity), and it's critical for developing higher-level software development skills. Remember, doing something once develops a very weak neural pathway, and since we general struggle with new things you may be have also ingrained all the missteps you took along the way.

Build and burns can be applied to almost any activity: Questions, exercises, projects, tutorials. Make it, get rid of it, repeat. What it lacks in novelty it more than makes up for in efficacy.
