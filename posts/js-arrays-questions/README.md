```js
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Carrot"]
```

> How would you print the "Carrot" element?

> Convert these variables to an array:

```js
const user1 = "Pat"
const user2 = "Enrique"
const user3 = "Dominique"
```

> Combine these two arrays:

```js
const firstArray = ["A", "B", "C"]
const secondArray = ["D", "E", "F"]
```
