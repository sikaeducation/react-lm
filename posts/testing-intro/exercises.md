Write responses to each of these reasons not to write tests:

* "Testing takes too long, I feel like I spend more time screwing around with the tests than I do writing code"
* "Unit tests only guarantee that the little parts work, but doesn't verify that any of them work together"
* "We really high test coverage, but we still have lots of bugs and I'm not sure what our tests are actually doing"
* "We don't have time to write tests, the investors really need us to write features"
* "We'll just write the tests later"
* "I'm developer, not a tester!"

Describe the following scenarios as unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests, or static tests:

* A guarantee that an addition function only accepts numbers
* A test that opens a web page, clicks a button, and verifies that something appears on the page
* A test that verifies that a function returns the correct values
* A test that verifies that the code for a feature works correctly
