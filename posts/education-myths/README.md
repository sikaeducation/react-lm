There are a lot of myths about education that we learn, explicitly and implicitly, through school. Here are some of the most common/unhelpful:

* **Learning Styles**: There is no evidence that people have a predominant style (visual, auditory, reading, kinesthetic) that best helps them retain information. The reality is that good education is multimodal.
* **Androgogy**: There is no evidence that adult learners have different needs than young learners. The principles of Malcolm Knowles' androgogy are sound, but are also applicable to children.
* **Educational content**: Content such as articles, videos, and direct instruction is an important ingredient in education, but the most important part is feedback loops.
* **Homework**: There's no evidence that homework improves learning. With learning, frequency is more important than duration, and taking time to limit sensory input is an important part of locking in new knowledge.
