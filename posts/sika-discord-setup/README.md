# Sika Discord Setup

Discord is a robust chat tool for communities and will be the primary means of communication for the course. To set up Discord, go the [Discord site](https://discord.com/), download and install Discord (or open it in the browser) and create an account.

You'll need to be invited to Sika's Discord server, but for reference the server ID is `912145236380246036`.

## Discord Concepts

Most Discord concepts are similar to those used by other chat programs such as Slack, but a couple are different. For reference:

* **Server**: A collection of channels using a common set of rules and administrators
* **Mentions**: To mention someone in a message, put an `@` before their username. This notifies them that you posted the message.
* **Group Mentions**: To mention everyone in the class at the same time, use `@ford`
* **Channels**: A channel is a chat room focused on a specific topic, and is referenced by putting `#` before the channel name (eg. `#channel-name-goes-here`). Channels can be public (everyone on the server can read and post) or private (only specific people can read and post).
* **Direct Messages**: DMs work differently on Discord than they do on many chat platforms. DMs exist completely separately from servers, and can be accessed through Discord home (the icon of the robot). DMs can be 1:1 or group.
* **Threads**: A thread is effectively a temporary channel. You can list active threads by hovering over the channel name.
* **Replies**: Replies are a way to indicate what you're responding to. This is especially helpful when conversations start overlapping, but don't warrant a thread.
* **Emoji**: To use emoji in your post, surround the name of the emoji with colons: `:emoji-name-here:`. Note that on Discord, some emoji are only available if you subscribe to Discord ($5 a month). A Discord subscription is not necessary for any Sika program.

## Channels

### `#nwm`

This is our primary channel and is private to us. Announcements, schedules, video links, and questions about the class (like what time something is happening at) go here.

### `#the-queue`

This is the technical help channel and is public. Use this for questions about making software. Use this instead of DMing people for help. Some notes:

* Post the question in the channel and then make a new thread for replies
* Help each other! Staff is monitoring the channel, but these interactions are more meaningful between learners.
* Some of the people in the channel are former educators and learners from Sika-affiliated programs. They know what you're going through and want to help too!
* When a question is resolved, add a checkmark emoji such as `:white_check-mark:` to the original question.

### `#general`

This channel is public to all Sika-affiliated folks. Most of them are former staff and learners from previous programs.

## Tips

* Rather than using a mouse to switch between channels and DMs, use `Control`+`k` to pull up a channel and message search tool.
* You can add an emoji to the most recent post by prefixing it with `+`, like `+:thumbs-up:`
* There's a drop-in voice channel you are free to use to talk with each other out loud
