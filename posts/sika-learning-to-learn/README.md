# Learning to Learn

Perhaps the most critical skill for any professional software engineer is the ability to learn. By definition, technology changes faster than anything else. Being a professional means keeping up with change, and you will rarely have formal training opportunities handed to you. Here are some tips for your journey to learn to learn:

## Prioritize Application

Reading content, sitting through lectures, and watching videos is comfortable and safe. Unfortunately, it's difficult to learn a place of comfort. Learning comes from trying something uncomfortable, getting feedback, and trying to apply that feedback.

Content is an important piece of the equation because it helps position skills and knowledge relative to things you already know and guides your initial attempts at application. It's not a substitute though; if your fingers haven't done something on a keyboard, you don't know it. Even if it's scary, even if you have no idea what you're doing, even if you feel positive you won't be able to finish, you **have** to prioritize application over content.

## Note-Taking

If you have a note-taking system that works for you, use it. Otherwise, you may find the following system helpful:

1. Your first time through a piece of content, just observe. Your goal is to get a sense of the overall shape of the content; what the major goals are, where it starts and stops, what's simple and what's complex. It's OK to not be able to recall much after this pass.
2. Your second time through the same content, start with an outline of the major topics and then take aggressive notes (in your own words) throughout a slow, purposeful read. Interrogate your own understanding and don't autopilot over tricky parts.
3. Lastly, go back over your notes and transform them from being driven by the outline the original author had into one that's more meaningful for you. That might mean grouping it differently, relating with things you already know, coming up with your own mnemonics and mental models, or drawing pictures. The goal is to synthesize the facts and perspectives you've received into something that's entirely yours.

This system is very slow and requires a lot of effort. That means that you have to be judicious about what content you apply this process to because there's not enough time to do this with everything. It's also much more effective than just writing down interesting things as you notice them or just doing a high-level outline. In education, this is referred to as transcribing the authors' notes into your notes without going through your brain first.

## Gradual Release of Responsibility

At the beginning of the program, the content and activities are more structured and directed. As the program goes on, it intentionally becomes less so. This is called a "gradual release of responsibility", and it's designed to prepare you for work as a professional developer. Professional developers don't get worksheets or well-structured assignments to work on. In fact, discovering what needs to be done and making a plan for how to do is one of most important professional skills for any engineer.

It will occasionally feel like being abandoned, but it's closer to walking a tightrope. You're doing all the work and it feels indistinguishable from being in actual danger, but there's always a safety net under you. From the first day to the last, there is always something to do. If at any point in the program you're not sure what that is, use your Personal Empowerment Protocol.
